## Description
This is a microservices application built using TypeScript, Node.js, and Next.js, designed to demonstrate how to build a scalable and maintainable microservices architecture. It includes examples of how to use Docker and Kubernetes for deployment, as well as Jest and Redis for testing. 

## Architecture
The application is built using microservices architecture. Each service is a standalone module that communicates with other services using APIs. The services communicate with each other using RESTful APIs.

## Technology Stack
The following technologies are used to build this application:
   . Node.js
   . Next.js
   . Docker
   . Kubernetes
   
   
• Developed the project using TypeScript, Express, and MongoDB for building a robust and scalable backend.  
• Utilized Jest and Redis for automated and efficient in-memory testing of the application.  
• Implemented response normalization techniques to ensure adaptability with polyglot implementation.  
• Leveraged containerization with Docker for streamlined deployment and management of the application.  
• Utilized Kubernetes and Skaffold for container orchestration and seamless development workflows.  
• Implemented Ingress-Nginx to establish routing protocols and expose services to the outside world.  
• Utilized NATS Streaming Server as an event bus between services, employing features like queue groups to handle multiple replicas and resolve concurrency issues.  
• Intend to learn DevOps tools such as Terraform and Jenkins to incorporate infrastructure as code and enable efficient software development practices.  
• Aim to expand knowledge of Linux systems, including command-line usage, system administration, and shell scripting.  
• Plan to gain expertise in cloud technologies, such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud, to enhance the project's scalability and resilience.  
• Looking forward to embracing polyglot programming by incorporating multiple languages or technology stacks to leverage their respective strengths and explore diverse 
solutions.
